#chooseurdistro

Almost all colleges will start regular classes by Feb first week. New
semester, new students with new laptops !!
Lets make our fist landing great and memorable with a college wide
installation fest, but slightly modified version of it with the title
of "chooseyourdistro". Going forward Possibly we should try to do this
every academic year beginning.

##So What is #chooseurdistro event ?

A modified version of normal installation fest. FSMK volunteers
demonstrates different leading OSs(we can decide 5-8 leading OS
followed by a quick survey among us) at the beginning of program.
Volunteers explain features with video/presentation or with the real
life scenarios. At the end of the program the actuall installation
fests start and students get a chance to choose an operating system
they liked much.

##Who will host the event ?

Each college GLUG to host the event and preferably do it college wide
in one or more phases.

##When we can conduct this program ?

In the month of Feb

##What preparation we need ?

I don’t think we have to be much prepared on it. However we need to
choose operating system that we would demostrate  and come up with
FSMK's custom distro with necessary academic packages installed with.
